# Overview

I have a goal to create applications that will be useful for me! This way I can further my learning and get something out of each project I work on!

The last couple weeks I have been working on this Upcoming Concerts web application! I thought it would be great to be able to search an band/artist and get all data on their upcoming concerts.

Check out the link below to see the short demo of my work!

# Future Work

* Implement cooler name for the app!

* When querying the database tables, the strings are case sensitive which has been causing some issues
* Allow the user to click on a link to navigate where they can buy tickets
